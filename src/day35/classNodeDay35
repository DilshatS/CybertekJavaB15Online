Day 35 // Saturday class review Note

Method practice with void and return type

return keyword :
    used to return a value from a method with return type
    also terminate the method execution (any method)

Using the methods already created in different classes

    in order to use a class outside of your current packAge
    import the class first
        import packageName.className;

    a special case for above statement is :
        you dont have to import classes from java.lang package
        for example String , System , Math
            All the Wrapper classses we are about to learn

    in order to use a static method of other classes
        ClassName.methodName(.....)

    in order to use a static method in current class
        methodName(....) ;
        OPTIONALLY
        ClassName.methodName(.....)


    Method Overloading :
        methods with same name and different parameter list
        IN SAME CLASS!!!!!!!!

        Different parameter list can be :
            different paremeters count
            different paremeters type
            or both
    Method Signature : method name + paremeters list

    method overloading only care about Method Signature
    It does not care about access modifier, return type , static or not

    fly(100);
    fly(100L); -->> This method call expecting a fly method
                    that accept long paramter

    class Plane{

        public static void fly(){
            // some code here
        }

        public static void fly(int mile){
            // some code here
        }
        // CAN NOT HAVE 2 METHODS WITH SAME METHOD SIGNATURE
        // THIS DOES NOT COMPILE
        public static long fly(int mileX){
            // some code here
        }

    }

    class Car{
        public static void fly(int mile){
            // some code here
        }
    }

    I have a employee ID : "FB-457"
    give me the employee number and store it into a method
